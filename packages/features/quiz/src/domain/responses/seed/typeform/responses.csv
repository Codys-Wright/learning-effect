*The Solo Artist*

You are the epitome of the serious, introspective, and self-contained artist. Your work is likely very personal and you more likely consider it to be a direct extension of who you are inside than most other Artist Types. You're not only comfortable working alone, but tend to prefer it over collaborations. Your core goal is to create work that is a direct reflection of your own tastes and perspectives. 

You tend to be self-sufficient in many ways and enjoy controlling most elements of your creative process because it makes it more personal and unique. As *The* *Solo Artist* you're likely known for the authenticity and uniqueness of your work, which is one of your most valuable artistic qualities.

Though you may be more reclusive and introverted than other artists, you're not necessarily anti-social. You're highly inventive and industrious and enjoy venturing into the artistic unknown to discover where it will lead. You're as interested in the process as the result.

Though you're most comfortable working alone, it can be beneficial to have limited collaborations (or get constructive feedback) from other artist types including: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this studied and technically proficient artist is often very experienced with collaborations. This might help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's used to working alone and is perhaps more eclectic, eccentric, or internal. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. This can be helpful for you in cases when you're perhaps too close to a project to have a balanced view on the overall picture.

• *The Entertainer Artist* - because they may be able to provide you a potentially valuable outside perspective on your work and when appropriate, help bring your work to life as a performer. 

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they tend to have a lighter touch and an openminded imaginative way of working which could help bring some interesting perspectives to your work, while also leaving plenty of space for you to do your thing the way you feel you need to.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this studied and technically proficient artist is often very experienced with collaborations. This might help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's used to working alone and is perhaps more eclectic, eccentric, or internal. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. This can be helpful for you in cases when you're perhaps too close to a project to have a balanced view on the overall picture.

• *The Entertainer Artist* - because they may be able to provide you a potentially valuable outside perspective on your work and when appropriate, help bring your work to life as a performer. 

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they tend to have a lighter touch and an openminded imaginative way of working which could help bring some interesting perspectives to your work, while also leaving plenty of space for you to do your thing the way you feel you need to.

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Entertainer Artist *

You live to perform. Whether for a huge audience or just one other person, you thrive on sharing your talents with people and feel right at home being the center of attention. You have a natural charisma and have a gift for bringing people together. You have the ability to light up a room with a unique and obvious energy that defies explanation.

You put the ""show"" in show business and have a natural ability to remember that sometimes it's all about giving your audience what they want. This is a highly valuable trait and something that other more introverted artist types can forget, or neglect.

Though you're often the star of the show (and rightly so), it can be helpful in creative situations to collaborate with those who have a more thoroughly introspective and measured artistic temperament. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help free you up to entertain, knowing that everything is taken care of with the utmost care. This is a usually a very mutually beneficial match.

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

• *The Tortured Artist* - because if there's ever a need for added emotional depth and a thorough commitment to authenticity, this artist is always attuned to those elements. If you get along personally, and navigate any disagreements well, you can form a tight bond that can bring exciting results.

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Dreamer Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to put some effort into ""sharing the stage"", so to speak. With an open mind, you're likely to feed off of each other's expressive energies and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include: 

* • The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent and balanced energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Tortured Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your deeply expressive ideas well, so you can stay in your sweet spot.
 
*• The Visionary Artist* - because they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide you there.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Consummate Artist*

You are as technically proficient as you are creative. You have good aesthetic taste and a meticulous approach to your craft. This makes you a very well balanced artist, who's capable of being highly adaptive to a variety situations. 

Your collaborators and associates are likely to consider you to be an asset to any project you're involved in. You have a gift for solving creative problems and providing the right idea at the right time while also choosing the right tool for the job from a technical or equipment perspective. Often *The Consummate Artist* is comfortable leading or supporting; whatever is called for in the moment or for a specific project.

You're artistically expressive and value raw authenticity, but never without concern for the overall objective quality of your work. You're highly analytical and at times you may find yourself more focused on finding and fixing flaws, than on enjoying what is naturally working. This can be a blessing and a curse, but it drives you forward toward excellence. 

You have a firm grasp of the relevant history of your chosen medium while also being focused on learning new things. You have natural desire to keep your finger on the pulse of the latest trends and likely tend to keep up with useful technological advancements. 

Though you're often highly creative, knowledgeable, and work well with most people, you can benefit greatly from seeking collaborations with those who tend to have a more free-spirited, self-taught, or abstract approach to creativity. These types include:

• *The Visionary Artist* - because this type is thinking big, they can provide a grand vision which you can help bring to life in practical ways. A very synergistic match. 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they are a wellspring of ideas that are emotionally rich yet often can come in random or disorganized ways that you can help order and aim effectively.

• *The Entertainer* *Artist* - because this type is always ready to bring ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, you can help make sure that the presentation is professional and that all the important details are covered; every ""i"" is dotted and every ""t"" crossed. Virtually every Entertainer would benefit from collaborating with a Studious Craftsman, and vice versa.

*• The Tortured Artist* - because their work is emotionally intense and tends to be less overtly and objectively intellectualized, you two can often act as yin and yang. This can be a best of both worlds combination if you get along personality wise. 
* *
• *The Dreamer* *Artist* - because the dreamer brings a highly imaginative ""head in the clouds"" energy to all they're involved in, they benefit from an organizational and guiding presence you provide. Conversely, you benefit from working with the ideas of someone who is tuned in with the intangible in ways that can make for highly effective collaborations.

Of all the artist types you are one of the most adaptive and naturally professional. In a world where many artists can be disorganized and unreliable, you are the exception and that is often greatly appreciated by those you work with.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include: 

* • The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent and balanced energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Tortured Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your deeply expressive ideas well, so you can stay in your sweet spot.
 
*• The Visionary Artist* - because they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide you there.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include: 

* • The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent and balanced energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Tortured Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your deeply expressive ideas well, so you can stay in your sweet spot.
 
*• The Visionary Artist* - because they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide you there.

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include: 

* • The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent and balanced energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Tortured Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your deeply expressive ideas well, so you can stay in your sweet spot.
 
*• The Visionary Artist* - because they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide you there.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed.

*The Consummate Artist*

You are as technically proficient as you are creative. You have good aesthetic taste and a meticulous approach to your craft. This makes you a very well balanced artist, who's capable of being highly adaptive to a variety situations. 

Your collaborators and associates are likely to consider you to be an asset to any project you're involved in. You have a gift for solving creative problems and providing the right idea at the right time while also choosing the right tool for the job from a technical or equipment perspective. Often *The Consummate Artist* is comfortable leading or supporting; whatever is called for in the moment or for a specific project.

You're artistically expressive and value raw authenticity, but never without concern for the overall objective quality of your work. You're highly analytical and at times you may find yourself more focused on finding and fixing flaws, than on enjoying what is naturally working. This can be a blessing and a curse, but it drives you forward toward excellence. 

You have a firm grasp of the relevant history of your chosen medium while also being focused on learning new things. You have natural desire to keep your finger on the pulse of the latest trends and likely tend to keep up with useful technological advancements. 

Though you're often highly creative, knowledgeable, and work well with most people, you can benefit greatly from seeking collaborations with those who tend to have a more free-spirited, self-taught, or abstract approach to creativity. These types include:

• *The Visionary Artist* - because this type is thinking big, they can provide a grand vision which you can help bring to life in practical ways. A very synergistic match. 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they are a wellspring of ideas that are emotionally rich yet often can come in random or disorganized ways that you can help order and aim effectively.

• *The Entertainer* *Artist* - because this type is always ready to bring ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, you can help make sure that the presentation is professional and that all the important details are covered; every ""i"" is dotted and every ""t"" crossed. Virtually every Entertainer would benefit from collaborating with a Studious Craftsman, and vice versa.

*• The Tortured Artist* - because their work is emotionally intense and tends to be less overtly and objectively intellectualized, you two can often act as yin and yang. This can be a best of both worlds combination if you get along personality wise. 
* *
• *The Dreamer* *Artist* - because the dreamer brings a highly imaginative ""head in the clouds"" energy to all they're involved in, they benefit from an organizational and guiding presence you provide. Conversely, you benefit from working with the ideas of someone who is tuned in with the intangible in ways that can make for highly effective collaborations.

Of all the artist types you are one of the most adaptive and naturally professional. In a world where many artists can be disorganized and unreliable, you are the exception and that is often greatly appreciated by those you work with.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Solo Artist*

You are the epitome of the serious, introspective, and self-contained artist. Your work is likely very personal and you more likely consider it to be a direct extension of who you are inside than most other Artist Types. You're not only comfortable working alone, but tend to prefer it over collaborations. Your core goal is to create work that is a direct reflection of your own tastes and perspectives. 

You tend to be self-sufficient in many ways and enjoy controlling most elements of your creative process because it makes it more personal and unique. As *The* *Solo Artist* you're likely known for the authenticity and uniqueness of your work, which is one of your most valuable artistic qualities.

Though you may be more reclusive and introverted than other artists, you're not necessarily anti-social. You're highly inventive and industrious and enjoy venturing into the artistic unknown to discover where it will lead. You're as interested in the process as the result.

Though you're most comfortable working alone, it can be beneficial to have limited collaborations (or get constructive feedback) from other artist types including: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this studied and technically proficient artist is often very experienced with collaborations. This might help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's used to working alone and is perhaps more eclectic, eccentric, or internal. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. This can be helpful for you in cases when you're perhaps too close to a project to have a balanced view on the overall picture.

• *The Entertainer Artist* - because they may be able to provide you a potentially valuable outside perspective on your work and when appropriate, help bring your work to life as a performer. 

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they tend to have a lighter touch and an openminded imaginative way of working which could help bring some interesting perspectives to your work, while also leaving plenty of space for you to do your thing the way you feel you need to.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Entertainer Artist *

You live to perform. Whether for a huge audience or just one other person, you thrive on sharing your talents with people and feel right at home being the center of attention. You have a natural charisma and have a gift for bringing people together. You have the ability to light up a room with a unique and obvious energy that defies explanation.

You put the ""show"" in show business and have a natural ability to remember that sometimes it's all about giving your audience what they want. This is a highly valuable trait and something that other more introverted artist types can forget, or neglect.

Though you're often the star of the show (and rightly so), it can be helpful in creative situations to collaborate with those who have a more thoroughly introspective and measured artistic temperament. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help free you up to entertain, knowing that everything is taken care of with the utmost care. This is a usually a very mutually beneficial match.

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

• *The Tortured Artist* - because if there's ever a need for added emotional depth and a thorough commitment to authenticity, this artist is always attuned to those elements. If you get along personally, and navigate any disagreements well, you can form a tight bond that can bring exciting results.

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Dreamer Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to put some effort into ""sharing the stage"", so to speak. With an open mind, you're likely to feed off of each other's expressive energies and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Solo Artist*

You are the epitome of the serious, introspective, and self-contained artist. Your work is likely very personal and you more likely consider it to be a direct extension of who you are inside than most other Artist Types. You're not only comfortable working alone, but tend to prefer it over collaborations. Your core goal is to create work that is a direct reflection of your own tastes and perspectives. 

You tend to be self-sufficient in many ways and enjoy controlling most elements of your creative process because it makes it more personal and unique. As *The* *Solo Artist* you're likely known for the authenticity and uniqueness of your work, which is one of your most valuable artistic qualities.

Though you may be more reclusive and introverted than other artists, you're not necessarily anti-social. You're highly inventive and industrious and enjoy venturing into the artistic unknown to discover where it will lead. You're as interested in the process as the result.

Though you're most comfortable working alone, it can be beneficial to have limited collaborations (or get constructive feedback) from other artist types including: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this studied and technically proficient artist is often very experienced with collaborations. This might help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's used to working alone and is perhaps more eclectic, eccentric, or internal. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. This can be helpful for you in cases when you're perhaps too close to a project to have a balanced view on the overall picture.

• *The Entertainer Artist* - because they may be able to provide you a potentially valuable outside perspective on your work and when appropriate, help bring your work to life as a performer. 

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they tend to have a lighter touch and an openminded imaginative way of working which could help bring some interesting perspectives to your work, while also leaving plenty of space for you to do your thing the way you feel you need to.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Solo Artist*

You are the epitome of the serious, introspective, and self-contained artist. Your work is likely very personal and you more likely consider it to be a direct extension of who you are inside than most other Artist Types. You're not only comfortable working alone, but tend to prefer it over collaborations. Your core goal is to create work that is a direct reflection of your own tastes and perspectives. 

You tend to be self-sufficient in many ways and enjoy controlling most elements of your creative process because it makes it more personal and unique. As *The* *Solo Artist* you're likely known for the authenticity and uniqueness of your work, which is one of your most valuable artistic qualities.

Though you may be more reclusive and introverted than other artists, you're not necessarily anti-social. You're highly inventive and industrious and enjoy venturing into the artistic unknown to discover where it will lead. You're as interested in the process as the result.

Though you're most comfortable working alone, it can be beneficial to have limited collaborations (or get constructive feedback) from other artist types including: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this studied and technically proficient artist is often very experienced with collaborations. This might help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's used to working alone and is perhaps more eclectic, eccentric, or internal. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. This can be helpful for you in cases when you're perhaps too close to a project to have a balanced view on the overall picture.

• *The Entertainer Artist* - because they may be able to provide you a potentially valuable outside perspective on your work and when appropriate, help bring your work to life as a performer. 

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they tend to have a lighter touch and an openminded imaginative way of working which could help bring some interesting perspectives to your work, while also leaving plenty of space for you to do your thing the way you feel you need to.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

You live to perform. Whether for a huge audience or just one other person, you thrive on sharing your talents with people and feel right at home being the center of attention. You have a natural charisma and have a gift for bringing people together. You have the ability to light up a room with a unique and obvious energy that defies explanation.

You put the ""show"" in show business and have a natural ability to remember that sometimes it's all about giving your audience what they want. This is a highly valuable trait and something that other more introverted artist types can forget, or neglect.

Though you're often the star of the show (and rightly so), it can be helpful in creative situations to collaborate with those who have a more thoroughly introspective and measured artistic temperament. These types include:

• *The Tortured Artist* - because if there's ever a need for added emotional depth and a thorough commitment to authenticity, this artist is always attuned to those elements. If you get along personally, and navigate any disagreements well, you can form a tight bond that can bring exciting results.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include: 

* • The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent and balanced energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Tortured Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your deeply expressive ideas well, so you can stay in your sweet spot.
 
*• The Visionary Artist* - because they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide you there.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work..

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include: 

* • The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent and balanced energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Tortured Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your deeply expressive ideas well, so you can stay in your sweet spot.
 
*• The Visionary Artist* - because they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide you there.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include: 

* • The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent and balanced energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Tortured Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your deeply expressive ideas well, so you can stay in your sweet spot.
 
*• The Visionary Artist* - because they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide you there.

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed.

*The Consummate Artist*

You are as technically proficient as you are creative. You have good aesthetic taste and a meticulous approach to your craft. This makes you a very well balanced artist, who's capable of being highly adaptive to a variety situations. 

Your collaborators and associates are likely to consider you to be an asset to any project you're involved in. You have a gift for solving creative problems and providing the right idea at the right time while also choosing the right tool for the job from a technical or equipment perspective. Often *The Consummate Artist* is comfortable leading or supporting; whatever is called for in the moment or for a specific project.

You're artistically expressive and value raw authenticity, but never without concern for the overall objective quality of your work. You're highly analytical and at times you may find yourself more focused on finding and fixing flaws, than on enjoying what is naturally working. This can be a blessing and a curse, but it drives you forward toward excellence. 

You have a firm grasp of the relevant history of your chosen medium while also being focused on learning new things. You have natural desire to keep your finger on the pulse of the latest trends and likely tend to keep up with useful technological advancements. 

Though you're often highly creative, knowledgeable, and work well with most people, you can benefit greatly from seeking collaborations with those who tend to have a more free-spirited, self-taught, or abstract approach to creativity. These types include:

• *The Visionary Artist* - because this type is thinking big, they can provide a grand vision which you can help bring to life in practical ways. A very synergistic match. 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they are a wellspring of ideas that are emotionally rich yet often can come in random or disorganized ways that you can help order and aim effectively.

• *The Entertainer* *Artist* - because this type is always ready to bring ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, you can help make sure that the presentation is professional and that all the important details are covered; every ""i"" is dotted and every ""t"" crossed. Virtually every Entertainer would benefit from collaborating with a Studious Craftsman, and vice versa.

*• The Tortured Artist* - because their work is emotionally intense and tends to be less overtly and objectively intellectualized, you two can often act as yin and yang. This can be a best of both worlds combination if you get along personality wise. 
* *
• *The Dreamer* *Artist* - because the dreamer brings a highly imaginative ""head in the clouds"" energy to all they're involved in, they benefit from an organizational and guiding presence you provide. Conversely, you benefit from working with the ideas of someone who is tuned in with the intangible in ways that can make for highly effective collaborations.

Of all the artist types you are one of the most adaptive and naturally professional. In a world where many artists can be disorganized and unreliable, you are the exception and that is often greatly appreciated by those you work with.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Entertainer Artist *

You live to perform. Whether for a huge audience or just one other person, you thrive on sharing your talents with people and feel right at home being the center of attention. You have a natural charisma and have a gift for bringing people together. You have the ability to light up a room with a unique and obvious energy that defies explanation.

You put the ""show"" in show business and have a natural ability to remember that sometimes it's all about giving your audience what they want. This is a highly valuable trait and something that other more introverted artist types can forget, or neglect.

Though you're often the star of the show (and rightly so), it can be helpful in creative situations to collaborate with those who have a more thoroughly introspective and measured artistic temperament. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help free you up to entertain, knowing that everything is taken care of with the utmost care. This is a usually a very mutually beneficial match.

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

• *The Tortured Artist* - because if there's ever a need for added emotional depth and a thorough commitment to authenticity, this artist is always attuned to those elements. If you get along personally, and navigate any disagreements well, you can form a tight bond that can bring exciting results.

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Dreamer Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to put some effort into ""sharing the stage"", so to speak. With an open mind, you're likely to feed off of each other's expressive energies and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Consummate Artist*

You are as technically proficient as you are creative. You have good aesthetic taste and a meticulous approach to your craft. This makes you a very well balanced artist, who's capable of being highly adaptive to a variety situations. 

Your collaborators and associates are likely to consider you to be an asset to any project you're involved in. You have a gift for solving creative problems and providing the right idea at the right time while also choosing the right tool for the job from a technical or equipment perspective. Often *The Consummate Artist* is comfortable leading or supporting; whatever is called for in the moment or for a specific project.

You're artistically expressive and value raw authenticity, but never without concern for the overall objective quality of your work. You're highly analytical and at times you may find yourself more focused on finding and fixing flaws, than on enjoying what is naturally working. This can be a blessing and a curse, but it drives you forward toward excellence. 

You have a firm grasp of the relevant history of your chosen medium while also being focused on learning new things. You have natural desire to keep your finger on the pulse of the latest trends and likely tend to keep up with useful technological advancements. 

Though you're often highly creative, knowledgeable, and work well with most people, you can benefit greatly from seeking collaborations with those who tend to have a more free-spirited, self-taught, or abstract approach to creativity. These types include:

• *The Visionary Artist* - because this type is thinking big, they can provide a grand vision which you can help bring to life in practical ways. A very synergistic match. 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they are a wellspring of ideas that are emotionally rich yet often can come in random or disorganized ways that you can help order and aim effectively.

• *The Entertainer* *Artist* - because this type is always ready to bring ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, you can help make sure that the presentation is professional and that all the important details are covered; every ""i"" is dotted and every ""t"" crossed. Virtually every Entertainer would benefit from collaborating with a Studious Craftsman, and vice versa.

*• The Tortured Artist* - because their work is emotionally intense and tends to be less overtly and objectively intellectualized, you two can often act as yin and yang. This can be a best of both worlds combination if you get along personality wise. 
* *
• *The Dreamer* *Artist* - because the dreamer brings a highly imaginative ""head in the clouds"" energy to all they're involved in, they benefit from an organizational and guiding presence you provide. Conversely, you benefit from working with the ideas of someone who is tuned in with the intangible in ways that can make for highly effective collaborations.

Of all the artist types you are one of the most adaptive and naturally professional. In a world where many artists can be disorganized and unreliable, you are the exception and that is often greatly appreciated by those you work with.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Consummate Artist*

You are as technically proficient as you are creative. You have good aesthetic taste and a meticulous approach to your craft. This makes you a very well balanced artist, who's capable of being highly adaptive to a variety situations. 

Your collaborators and associates are likely to consider you to be an asset to any project you're involved in. You have a gift for solving creative problems and providing the right idea at the right time while also choosing the right tool for the job from a technical or equipment perspective. Often *The Consummate Artist* is comfortable leading or supporting; whatever is called for in the moment or for a specific project.

You're artistically expressive and value raw authenticity, but never without concern for the overall objective quality of your work. You're highly analytical and at times you may find yourself more focused on finding and fixing flaws, than on enjoying what is naturally working. This can be a blessing and a curse, but it drives you forward toward excellence. 

You have a firm grasp of the relevant history of your chosen medium while also being focused on learning new things. You have natural desire to keep your finger on the pulse of the latest trends and likely tend to keep up with useful technological advancements. 

Though you're often highly creative, knowledgeable, and work well with most people, you can benefit greatly from seeking collaborations with those who tend to have a more free-spirited, self-taught, or abstract approach to creativity. These types include:

• *The Visionary Artist* - because this type is thinking big, they can provide a grand vision which you can help bring to life in practical ways. A very synergistic match. 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they are a wellspring of ideas that are emotionally rich yet often can come in random or disorganized ways that you can help order and aim effectively.

• *The Entertainer* *Artist* - because this type is always ready to bring ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, you can help make sure that the presentation is professional and that all the important details are covered; every ""i"" is dotted and every ""t"" crossed. Virtually every Entertainer would benefit from collaborating with a Studious Craftsman, and vice versa.

*• The Tortured Artist* - because their work is emotionally intense and tends to be less overtly and objectively intellectualized, you two can often act as yin and yang. This can be a best of both worlds combination if you get along personality wise. 
* *
• *The Dreamer* *Artist* - because the dreamer brings a highly imaginative ""head in the clouds"" energy to all they're involved in, they benefit from an organizational and guiding presence you provide. Conversely, you benefit from working with the ideas of someone who is tuned in with the intangible in ways that can make for highly effective collaborations.

Of all the artist types you are one of the most adaptive and naturally professional. In a world where many artists can be disorganized and unreliable, you are the exception and that is often greatly appreciated by those you work with.

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Entertainer Artist *

You live to perform. Whether for a huge audience or just one other person, you thrive on sharing your talents with people and feel right at home being the center of attention. You have a natural charisma and have a gift for bringing people together. You have the ability to light up a room with a unique and obvious energy that defies explanation.

You put the ""show"" in show business and have a natural ability to remember that sometimes it's all about giving your audience what they want. This is a highly valuable trait and something that other more introverted artist types can forget, or neglect.

Though you're often the star of the show (and rightly so), it can be helpful in creative situations to collaborate with those who have a more thoroughly introspective and measured artistic temperament. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help free you up to entertain, knowing that everything is taken care of with the utmost care. This is a usually a very mutually beneficial match.

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

• *The Tortured Artist* - because if there's ever a need for added emotional depth and a thorough commitment to authenticity, this artist is always attuned to those elements. If you get along personally, and navigate any disagreements well, you can form a tight bond that can bring exciting results.

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Dreamer Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to put some effort into ""sharing the stage"", so to speak. With an open mind, you're likely to feed off of each other's expressive energies and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include: 

* • The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent and balanced energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Tortured Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your deeply expressive ideas well, so you can stay in your sweet spot.
 
*• The Visionary Artist* - because they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide you there.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include:

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist.

Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

*The Solo Artist*

You are the epitome of the serious, introspective, and self-contained artist. Your work is likely very personal and you more likely consider it to be a direct extension of who you are inside than most other Artist Types. You're not only comfortable working alone, but tend to prefer it over collaborations. Your core goal is to create work that is a direct reflection of your own tastes and perspectives. 

You tend to be self-sufficient in many ways and enjoy controlling most elements of your creative process because it makes it more personal and unique. As *The* *Solo Artist* you're likely known for the authenticity and uniqueness of your work, which is one of your most valuable artistic qualities.

Though you may be more reclusive and introverted than other artists, you're not necessarily anti-social. You're highly inventive and industrious and enjoy venturing into the artistic unknown to discover where it will lead. You're as interested in the process as the result.

Though you're most comfortable working alone, it can be beneficial to have limited collaborations (or get constructive feedback) from other artist types including: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this studied and technically proficient artist is often very experienced with collaborations. This might help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's used to working alone and is perhaps more eclectic, eccentric, or internal. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. This can be helpful for you in cases when you're perhaps too close to a project to have a balanced view on the overall picture.

• *The Entertainer Artist* - because they may be able to provide you a potentially valuable outside perspective on your work and when appropriate, help bring your work to life as a performer. 

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they tend to have a lighter touch and an openminded imaginative way of working which could help bring some interesting perspectives to your work, while also leaving plenty of space for you to do your thing the way you feel you need to.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Solo Artist*

You are the epitome of the serious, introspective, and self-contained artist. Your work is likely very personal and you more likely consider it to be a direct extension of who you are inside than most other Artist Types. You're not only comfortable working alone, but tend to prefer it over collaborations. Your core goal is to create work that is a direct reflection of your own tastes and perspectives. 

You tend to be self-sufficient in many ways and enjoy controlling most elements of your creative process because it makes it more personal and unique. As *The* *Solo Artist* you're likely known for the authenticity and uniqueness of your work, which is one of your most valuable artistic qualities.

Though you may be more reclusive and introverted than other artists, you're not necessarily anti-social. You're highly inventive and industrious and enjoy venturing into the artistic unknown to discover where it will lead. You're as interested in the process as the result.

Though you're most comfortable working alone, it can be beneficial to have limited collaborations (or get constructive feedback) from other artist types including: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this studied and technically proficient artist is often very experienced with collaborations. This might help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's used to working alone and is perhaps more eclectic, eccentric, or internal. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. This can be helpful for you in cases when you're perhaps too close to a project to have a balanced view on the overall picture.

• *The Entertainer Artist* - because they may be able to provide you a potentially valuable outside perspective on your work and when appropriate, help bring your work to life as a performer. 

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they tend to have a lighter touch and an openminded imaginative way of working which could help bring some interesting perspectives to your work, while also leaving plenty of space for you to do your thing the way you feel you need to.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Entertainer Artist *

You live to perform. Whether for a huge audience or just one other person, you thrive on sharing your talents with people and feel right at home being the center of attention. You have a natural charisma and have a gift for bringing people together. You have the ability to light up a room with a unique and obvious energy that defies explanation.

You put the ""show"" in show business and have a natural ability to remember that sometimes it's all about giving your audience what they want. This is a highly valuable trait and something that other more introverted artist types can forget, or neglect.

Though you're often the star of the show (and rightly so), it can be helpful in creative situations to collaborate with those who have a more thoroughly introspective and measured artistic temperament. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help free you up to entertain, knowing that everything is taken care of with the utmost care. This is a usually a very mutually beneficial match.

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

• *The Tortured Artist* - because if there's ever a need for added emotional depth and a thorough commitment to authenticity, this artist is always attuned to those elements. If you get along personally, and navigate any disagreements well, you can form a tight bond that can bring exciting results.

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Dreamer Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to put some effort into ""sharing the stage"", so to speak. With an open mind, you're likely to feed off of each other's expressive energies and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Solo Artist*

You are the epitome of the serious, introspective, and self-contained artist. Your work is likely very personal and you more likely consider it to be a direct extension of who you are inside than most other Artist Types. You're not only comfortable working alone, but tend to prefer it over collaborations. Your core goal is to create work that is a direct reflection of your own tastes and perspectives. 

You tend to be self-sufficient in many ways and enjoy controlling most elements of your creative process because it makes it more personal and unique. As *The* *Solo Artist* you're likely known for the authenticity and uniqueness of your work, which is one of your most valuable artistic qualities.

Though you may be more reclusive and introverted than other artists, you're not necessarily anti-social. You're highly inventive and industrious and enjoy venturing into the artistic unknown to discover where it will lead. You're as interested in the process as the result.

Though you're most comfortable working alone, it can be beneficial to have limited collaborations (or get constructive feedback) from other artist types including: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this studied and technically proficient artist is often very experienced with collaborations. This might help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's used to working alone and is perhaps more eclectic, eccentric, or internal. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. This can be helpful for you in cases when you're perhaps too close to a project to have a balanced view on the overall picture.

• *The Entertainer Artist* - because they may be able to provide you a potentially valuable outside perspective on your work and when appropriate, help bring your work to life as a performer. 

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they tend to have a lighter touch and an openminded imaginative way of working which could help bring some interesting perspectives to your work, while also leaving plenty of space for you to do your thing the way you feel you need to.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include: 

* • The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent and balanced energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Tortured Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your deeply expressive ideas well, so you can stay in your sweet spot.
 
*• The Visionary Artist* - because they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide you there.

*The Consummate Artist*

You are as technically proficient as you are creative. You have good aesthetic taste and a meticulous approach to your craft. This makes you a very well balanced artist, who's capable of being highly adaptive to a variety situations. 

Your collaborators and associates are likely to consider you to be an asset to any project you're involved in. You have a gift for solving creative problems and providing the right idea at the right time while also choosing the right tool for the job from a technical or equipment perspective. Often *The Consummate Artist* is comfortable leading or supporting; whatever is called for in the moment or for a specific project.

You're artistically expressive and value raw authenticity, but never without concern for the overall objective quality of your work. You're highly analytical and at times you may find yourself more focused on finding and fixing flaws, than on enjoying what is naturally working. This can be a blessing and a curse, but it drives you forward toward excellence. 

You have a firm grasp of the relevant history of your chosen medium while also being focused on learning new things. You have natural desire to keep your finger on the pulse of the latest trends and likely tend to keep up with useful technological advancements. 

Though you're often highly creative, knowledgeable, and work well with most people, you can benefit greatly from seeking collaborations with those who tend to have a more free-spirited, self-taught, or abstract approach to creativity. These types include:

• *The Visionary Artist* - because this type is thinking big, they can provide a grand vision which you can help bring to life in practical ways. A very synergistic match. 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they are a wellspring of ideas that are emotionally rich yet often can come in random or disorganized ways that you can help order and aim effectively.

• *The Entertainer* *Artist* - because this type is always ready to bring ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, you can help make sure that the presentation is professional and that all the important details are covered; every ""i"" is dotted and every ""t"" crossed. Virtually every Entertainer would benefit from collaborating with a Studious Craftsman, and vice versa.

*• The Tortured Artist* - because their work is emotionally intense and tends to be less overtly and objectively intellectualized, you two can often act as yin and yang. This can be a best of both worlds combination if you get along personality wise. 
* *
• *The Dreamer* *Artist* - because the dreamer brings a highly imaginative ""head in the clouds"" energy to all they're involved in, they benefit from an organizational and guiding presence you provide. Conversely, you benefit from working with the ideas of someone who is tuned in with the intangible in ways that can make for highly effective collaborations.

Of all the artist types you are one of the most adaptive and naturally professional. In a world where many artists can be disorganized and unreliable, you are the exception and that is often greatly appreciated by those you work with.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Solo Artist*

You are the epitome of the serious, introspective, and self-contained artist. Your work is likely very personal and you more likely consider it to be a direct extension of who you are inside than most other Artist Types. You're not only comfortable working alone, but tend to prefer it over collaborations. Your core goal is to create work that is a direct reflection of your own tastes and perspectives. 

You tend to be self-sufficient in many ways and enjoy controlling most elements of your creative process because it makes it more personal and unique. As *The* *Solo Artist* you're likely known for the authenticity and uniqueness of your work, which is one of your most valuable artistic qualities.

Though you may be more reclusive and introverted than other artists, you're not necessarily anti-social. You're highly inventive and industrious and enjoy venturing into the artistic unknown to discover where it will lead. You're as interested in the process as the result.

Though you're most comfortable working alone, it can be beneficial to have limited collaborations (or get constructive feedback) from other artist types including: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this studied and technically proficient artist is often very experienced with collaborations. This might help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's used to working alone and is perhaps more eclectic, eccentric, or internal. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. This can be helpful for you in cases when you're perhaps too close to a project to have a balanced view on the overall picture.

• *The Entertainer Artist* - because they may be able to provide you a potentially valuable outside perspective on your work and when appropriate, help bring your work to life as a performer. 

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they tend to have a lighter touch and an openminded imaginative way of working which could help bring some interesting perspectives to your work, while also leaving plenty of space for you to do your thing the way you feel you need to.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include: 

* • The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent and balanced energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Tortured Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your deeply expressive ideas well, so you can stay in your sweet spot.
 
*• The Visionary Artist* - because they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide you there.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include: 

* • The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent and balanced energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Tortured Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your deeply expressive ideas well, so you can stay in your sweet spot.
 
*• The Visionary Artist* - because they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide you there.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Consummate Artist*

You are as technically proficient as you are creative. You have good aesthetic taste and a meticulous approach to your craft. This makes you a very well balanced artist, who's capable of being highly adaptive to a variety situations. 

Your collaborators and associates are likely to consider you to be an asset to any project you're involved in. You have a gift for solving creative problems and providing the right idea at the right time while also choosing the right tool for the job from a technical or equipment perspective. Often *The Consummate Artist* is comfortable leading or supporting; whatever is called for in the moment or for a specific project.

You're artistically expressive and value raw authenticity, but never without concern for the overall objective quality of your work. You're highly analytical and at times you may find yourself more focused on finding and fixing flaws, than on enjoying what is naturally working. This can be a blessing and a curse, but it drives you forward toward excellence. 

You have a firm grasp of the relevant history of your chosen medium while also being focused on learning new things. You have natural desire to keep your finger on the pulse of the latest trends and likely tend to keep up with useful technological advancements. 

Though you're often highly creative, knowledgeable, and work well with most people, you can benefit greatly from seeking collaborations with those who tend to have a more free-spirited, self-taught, or abstract approach to creativity. These types include:

• *The Visionary Artist* - because this type is thinking big, they can provide a grand vision which you can help bring to life in practical ways. A very synergistic match. 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they are a wellspring of ideas that are emotionally rich yet often can come in random or disorganized ways that you can help order and aim effectively.

• *The Entertainer* *Artist* - because this type is always ready to bring ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, you can help make sure that the presentation is professional and that all the important details are covered; every ""i"" is dotted and every ""t"" crossed. Virtually every Entertainer would benefit from collaborating with a Studious Craftsman, and vice versa.

*• The Tortured Artist* - because their work is emotionally intense and tends to be less overtly and objectively intellectualized, you two can often act as yin and yang. This can be a best of both worlds combination if you get along personality wise. 
* *
• *The Dreamer* *Artist* - because the dreamer brings a highly imaginative ""head in the clouds"" energy to all they're involved in, they benefit from an organizational and guiding presence you provide. Conversely, you benefit from working with the ideas of someone who is tuned in with the intangible in ways that can make for highly effective collaborations.

Of all the artist types you are one of the most adaptive and naturally professional. In a world where many artists can be disorganized and unreliable, you are the exception and that is often greatly appreciated by those you work with.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Consummate Artist*

You are as technically proficient as you are creative. You have good aesthetic taste and a meticulous approach to your craft. This makes you a very well balanced artist, who's capable of being highly adaptive to a variety situations. 

Your collaborators and associates are likely to consider you to be an asset to any project you're involved in. You have a gift for solving creative problems and providing the right idea at the right time while also choosing the right tool for the job from a technical or equipment perspective. Often *The Consummate Artist* is comfortable leading or supporting; whatever is called for in the moment or for a specific project.

You're artistically expressive and value raw authenticity, but never without concern for the overall objective quality of your work. You're highly analytical and at times you may find yourself more focused on finding and fixing flaws, than on enjoying what is naturally working. This can be a blessing and a curse, but it drives you forward toward excellence. 

You have a firm grasp of the relevant history of your chosen medium while also being focused on learning new things. You have natural desire to keep your finger on the pulse of the latest trends and likely tend to keep up with useful technological advancements. 

Though you're often highly creative, knowledgeable, and work well with most people, you can benefit greatly from seeking collaborations with those who tend to have a more free-spirited, self-taught, or abstract approach to creativity. These types include:

• *The Visionary Artist* - because this type is thinking big, they can provide a grand vision which you can help bring to life in practical ways. A very synergistic match. 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they are a wellspring of ideas that are emotionally rich yet often can come in random or disorganized ways that you can help order and aim effectively.

• *The Entertainer* *Artist* - because this type is always ready to bring ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, you can help make sure that the presentation is professional and that all the important details are covered; every ""i"" is dotted and every ""t"" crossed. Virtually every Entertainer would benefit from collaborating with a Studious Craftsman, and vice versa.

*• The Tortured Artist* - because their work is emotionally intense and tends to be less overtly and objectively intellectualized, you two can often act as yin and yang. This can be a best of both worlds combination if you get along personality wise. 
* *
• *The Dreamer* *Artist* - because the dreamer brings a highly imaginative ""head in the clouds"" energy to all they're involved in, they benefit from an organizational and guiding presence you provide. Conversely, you benefit from working with the ideas of someone who is tuned in with the intangible in ways that can make for highly effective collaborations.

Of all the artist types you are one of the most adaptive and naturally professional. In a world where many artists can be disorganized and unreliable, you are the exception and that is often greatly appreciated by those you work with.

You live to perform. Whether for a huge audience or just one other person, you thrive on sharing your talents with people and feel right at home being the center of attention. You have a natural charisma and have a gift for bringing people together. You have the ability to light up a room with a unique and obvious energy that defies explanation.

You put the ""show"" in show business and have a natural ability to remember that sometimes it's all about giving your audience what they want. This is a highly valuable trait and something that other more introverted artist types can forget, or neglect.

Though you're often the star of the show (and rightly so), it can be helpful in creative situations to collaborate with those who have a more thoroughly introspective and measured artistic temperament. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help free you up to entertain, knowing that everything is taken care of with the utmost care. This is a usually a very mutually beneficial match.

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

• *The Tortured Artist* - because if there's ever a need for added emotional depth and a thorough commitment to authenticity, this artist is always attuned to those elements. If you get along personally, and navigate any disagreements well, you can form a tight bond that can bring exciting results.

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Dreamer Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to put some effort into ""sharing the stage"", so to speak. With an open mind, you're likely to feed off of each other's expressive energies and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

*The Consummate Artist*

You are as technically proficient as you are creative. You have good aesthetic taste and a meticulous approach to your craft. This makes you a very well balanced artist, who's capable of being highly adaptive to a variety situations. 

Your collaborators and associates are likely to consider you to be an asset to any project you're involved in. You have a gift for solving creative problems and providing the right idea at the right time while also choosing the right tool for the job from a technical or equipment perspective. Often *The Consummate Artist* is comfortable leading or supporting; whatever is called for in the moment or for a specific project.

You're artistically expressive and value raw authenticity, but never without concern for the overall objective quality of your work. You're highly analytical and at times you may find yourself more focused on finding and fixing flaws, than on enjoying what is naturally working. This can be a blessing and a curse, but it drives you forward toward excellence. 

You have a firm grasp of the relevant history of your chosen medium while also being focused on learning new things. You have natural desire to keep your finger on the pulse of the latest trends and likely tend to keep up with useful technological advancements. 

Though you're often highly creative, knowledgeable, and work well with most people, you can benefit greatly from seeking collaborations with those who tend to have a more free-spirited, self-taught, or abstract approach to creativity. These types include:

• *The Visionary Artist* - because this type is thinking big, they can provide a grand vision which you can help bring to life in practical ways. A very synergistic match. 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they are a wellspring of ideas that are emotionally rich yet often can come in random or disorganized ways that you can help order and aim effectively.

• *The Entertainer* *Artist* - because this type is always ready to bring ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, you can help make sure that the presentation is professional and that all the important details are covered; every ""i"" is dotted and every ""t"" crossed. Virtually every Entertainer would benefit from collaborating with a Studious Craftsman, and vice versa.

*• The Tortured Artist* - because their work is emotionally intense and tends to be less overtly and objectively intellectualized, you two can often act as yin and yang. This can be a best of both worlds combination if you get along personality wise. 
* *
• *The Dreamer* *Artist* - because the dreamer brings a highly imaginative ""head in the clouds"" energy to all they're involved in, they benefit from an organizational and guiding presence you provide. Conversely, you benefit from working with the ideas of someone who is tuned in with the intangible in ways that can make for highly effective collaborations.

Of all the artist types you are one of the most adaptive and naturally professional. In a world where many artists can be disorganized and unreliable, you are the exception and that is often greatly appreciated by those you work with.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout.

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Entertainer Artist *

You live to perform. Whether for a huge audience or just one other person, you thrive on sharing your talents with people and feel right at home being the center of attention. You have a natural charisma and have a gift for bringing people together. You have the ability to light up a room with a unique and obvious energy that defies explanation.

You put the ""show"" in show business and have a natural ability to remember that sometimes it's all about giving your audience what they want. This is a highly valuable trait and something that other more introverted artist types can forget, or neglect.

Though you're often the star of the show (and rightly so), it can be helpful in creative situations to collaborate with those who have a more thoroughly introspective and measured artistic temperament. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help free you up to entertain, knowing that everything is taken care of with the utmost care. This is a usually a very mutually beneficial match.

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

• *The Tortured Artist* - because if there's ever a need for added emotional depth and a thorough commitment to authenticity, this artist is always attuned to those elements. If you get along personally, and navigate any disagreements well, you can form a tight bond that can bring exciting results.

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Dreamer Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to put some effort into ""sharing the stage"", so to speak. With an open mind, you're likely to feed off of each other's expressive energies and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

You're not only comfortable working alone, but tend to prefer it over collaborations. Your core goal is to create work that is a direct reflection of your own tastes and perspectives. 

You tend to be self-sufficient in many ways and enjoy controlling most elements of your creative process because it makes it more personal and unique. As *The* *Solo Artist* you're likely known for the authenticity and uniqueness of your work, which is one of your most valuable artistic qualities.

Though you may be more reclusive and introverted than other artists, you're not necessarily anti-social. You're highly inventive and industrious and enjoy venturing into the artistic unknown to discover where it will lead. You're as interested in the process as the result.

Though you're most comfortable working alone, it can be beneficial to have limited collaborations (or get constructive feedback) from other artist types including: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this studied and technically proficient artist is often very experienced with collaborations. This might help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's used to working alone and is perhaps more eclectic, eccentric, or internal. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. This can be helpful for you in cases when you're perhaps too close to a project to have a balanced view on the overall picture.

• *The Entertainer Artist* - because they may be able to provide you a potentially valuable outside perspective on your work and when appropriate, help bring your work to life as a performer. 

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they tend to have a lighter touch and an openminded imaginative way of working which could help bring some interesting perspectives to your work, while also leaving plenty of space for you to do your thing the way you feel you need to.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Tortured Artist*

Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits you well; you really do tend to suffer for your artistry. Your work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.

You often deal with significant internal tension during your creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, you're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though you may have a melancholic disposition, you often find solace and comfort in it.

When it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for you to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing your work. Though you feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's your sensitivity that makes your work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business. 

 In many ways the difficulties you deal with during your creative process are just extensions of your ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead you naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like you who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both you and your audiences. 

Due to your sensitive nature, it's particularly important for you to focus on self-care and avoid abusing substances that though they can numb your pain temporarily, can eventually become a stifling force in your life and work. The world needs artists like you! 

Due to the fact that you take your work very seriously and tend toward melancholy, you can benefit from collaborating with other Artist Types who can uplift and propel you forward in a way that is balancing. These include: 

* • The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent and balanced energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Tortured Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your deeply expressive ideas well, so you can stay in your sweet spot.
 
*• The Visionary Artist* - because they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide you there.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Entertainer Artist *

You live to perform. Whether for a huge audience or just one other person, you thrive on sharing your talents with people and feel right at home being the center of attention. You have a natural charisma and have a gift for bringing people together. You have the ability to light up a room with a unique and obvious energy that defies explanation.

You put the ""show"" in show business and have a natural ability to remember that sometimes it's all about giving your audience what they want. This is a highly valuable trait and something that other more introverted artist types can forget, or neglect.

Though you're often the star of the show (and rightly so), it can be helpful in creative situations to collaborate with those who have a more thoroughly introspective and measured artistic temperament. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help free you up to entertain, knowing that everything is taken care of with the utmost care. This is a usually a very mutually beneficial match.

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

• *The Tortured Artist* - because if there's ever a need for added emotional depth and a thorough commitment to authenticity, this artist is always attuned to those elements. If you get along personally, and navigate any disagreements well, you can form a tight bond that can bring exciting results.

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Dreamer Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to put some effort into ""sharing the stage"", so to speak. With an open mind, you're likely to feed off of each other's expressive energies and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types.

*The Feeler Artist*

You are emotionally present and highly expressive. You have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. Your sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines you creatively. You have a gift for bringing emotional depth to your work, particularly when you feel comfortable and free. 

You bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and exciting ideas. In collaborations you're likely to feel most at home when your collaborators respect your process and welcome the ideas as they flow from you. 

When you're comfortable and focused, you're a “lightning in a bottle” factory. For this reason, you'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that you can shut down creatively if you don't feel supported, or when your work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way. 

As *The Feeler Artist*, your strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes you may find it difficult to see beyond what you're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, your ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability. To stay in your sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important to listen to your internal stress signals so you'll know when you may need a break to recenter, so you can get back to where you need to be emotionally to create at your best. When you take responsibility for your emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, your sensitivity is your artistic and relational super-power. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is your specialty.

*The Feeler Artist* is most succinctly defined by what we call ""The 3 F's""; 

*• Focus*
*• Feel*
*• Follow*

You're able to *Focus* on the here and now, as you *Feel* in touch with your current emotions while knowing how to *Follow* your instincts while creating. You're an asset to most any creative situation. 

If you find yourself collaborating with another *Feeler Artist*, you'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so proceed with care! If you do, you can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.. 

To help balance your creative nature, you'll often be most productive and do your best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your expressive ideas well, so you can stay in the zone.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization. 

_*When you can choose collaborators who balance your more pronounced tendencies, you're more likely to have more consistent success and experience deep and lasting fulfillment in your work.*_

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Analyzer Artist*

You have a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. You know what you like and what you don't like and you hold yourself to high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives you forward and helps you push yourself toward excellence. 

More so than many other artist types you're willing to be hard on yourself and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout. For this reason it can be incredibly helpful to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to your often intense approach. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because their highly technical and professional approach can help give you a balanced, objective perspective at times when you might be too hard on yourself. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided your personalities and tastes interact well. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high-level results through using their technical prowess. 

*• The Visionary Artist* - because this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments your highly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing. 

When collaborating with *The Feeler Artist*, *The Solo Artist*, or *The Tortured Artist*, it's helpful to consider that you have similar temperaments so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present at time. With a foundation of mutual respect, you're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find you have a unique kinship with those similar types. You both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.

*The Consummate Artist*

You are as technically proficient as you are creative. You have good aesthetic taste and a meticulous approach to your craft. This makes you a very well balanced artist, who's capable of being highly adaptive to a variety situations. 

Your collaborators and associates are likely to consider you to be an asset to any project you're involved in. You have a gift for solving creative problems and providing the right idea at the right time while also choosing the right tool for the job from a technical or equipment perspective. Often *The Consummate Artist* is comfortable leading or supporting; whatever is called for in the moment or for a specific project.

You're artistically expressive and value raw authenticity, but never without concern for the overall objective quality of your work. You're highly analytical and at times you may find yourself more focused on finding and fixing flaws, than on enjoying what is naturally working. This can be a blessing and a curse, but it drives you forward toward excellence. 

You have a firm grasp of the relevant history of your chosen medium while also being focused on learning new things. You have natural desire to keep your finger on the pulse of the latest trends and likely tend to keep up with useful technological advancements. 

Though you're often highly creative, knowledgeable, and work well with most people, you can benefit greatly from seeking collaborations with those who tend to have a more free-spirited, self-taught, or abstract approach to creativity. These types include:

• *The Visionary Artist* - because this type is thinking big, they can provide a grand vision which you can help bring to life in practical ways. A very synergistic match. 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they are a wellspring of ideas that are emotionally rich yet often can come in random or disorganized ways that you can help order and aim effectively.

• *The Entertainer* *Artist* - because this type is always ready to bring ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, you can help make sure that the presentation is professional and that all the important details are covered; every ""i"" is dotted and every ""t"" crossed. Virtually every Entertainer would benefit from collaborating with a Studious Craftsman, and vice versa.

*• The Tortured Artist* - because their work is emotionally intense and tends to be less overtly and objectively intellectualized, you two can often act as yin and yang. This can be a best of both worlds combination if you get along personality wise. 
* *
• *The Dreamer* *Artist* - because the dreamer brings a highly imaginative ""head in the clouds"" energy to all they're involved in, they benefit from an organizational and guiding presence you provide. Conversely, you benefit from working with the ideas of someone who is tuned in with the intangible in ways that can make for highly effective collaborations.

Of all the artist types you are one of the most adaptive and naturally professional. In a world where many artists can be disorganized and unreliable, you are the exception and that is often greatly appreciated by those you work with.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Consummate Artist*

You are as technically proficient as you are creative. You have good aesthetic taste and a meticulous approach to your craft. This makes you a very well balanced artist, who's capable of being highly adaptive to a variety situations. 

Your collaborators and associates are likely to consider you to be an asset to any project you're involved in. You have a gift for solving creative problems and providing the right idea at the right time while also choosing the right tool for the job from a technical or equipment perspective. Often *The Consummate Artist* is comfortable leading or supporting; whatever is called for in the moment or for a specific project.

You're artistically expressive and value raw authenticity, but never without concern for the overall objective quality of your work. You're highly analytical and at times you may find yourself more focused on finding and fixing flaws, than on enjoying what is naturally working. This can be a blessing and a curse, but it drives you forward toward excellence. 

You have a firm grasp of the relevant history of your chosen medium while also being focused on learning new things. You have natural desire to keep your finger on the pulse of the latest trends and likely tend to keep up with useful technological advancements. 

Though you're often highly creative, knowledgeable, and work well with most people, you can benefit greatly from seeking collaborations with those who tend to have a more free-spirited, self-taught, or abstract approach to creativity. These types include:

• *The Visionary Artist* - because this type is thinking big, they can provide a grand vision which you can help bring to life in practical ways. A very synergistic match. 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they are a wellspring of ideas that are emotionally rich yet often can come in random or disorganized ways that you can help order and aim effectively.

• *The Entertainer* *Artist* - because this type is always ready to bring ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, you can help make sure that the presentation is professional and that all the important details are covered; every ""i"" is dotted and every ""t"" crossed. Virtually every Entertainer would benefit from collaborating with a Studious Craftsman, and vice versa.

*• The Tortured Artist* - because their work is emotionally intense and tends to be less overtly and objectively intellectualized, you two can often act as yin and yang. This can be a best of both worlds combination if you get along personality wise. 
* *
• *The Dreamer* *Artist* - because the dreamer brings a highly imaginative ""head in the clouds"" energy to all they're involved in, they benefit from an organizational and guiding presence you provide. Conversely, you benefit from working with the ideas of someone who is tuned in with the intangible in ways that can make for highly effective collaborations.

Of all the artist types you are one of the most adaptive and naturally professional. In a world where many artists can be disorganized and unreliable, you are the exception and that is often greatly appreciated by those you work with.

*The Dreamer Artist*

You are highly creative and have a vivid imagination. You thrive on delving deep into your internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think you have your ""head in the clouds”, you know intuitively that it's not only where you're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found. 

As a Dreamer Artist you can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When you can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions you will greatly increase your odds of success as an artist. 

Though your artistic imagination is an asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of your chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on you. These types include:

• *The Consummate Artist* - because this well studied, technically proficient artist can help bring some balance to the side of your artistry that's more eccentric when needed. 

• *The Visionary Artist* - because they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. 

• *The Maverick Artist* - because they are not only predisposed to understanding your imaginative ways. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup of types.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.

Though it's most often a positive thing, your tech-focused focused nature can pull your focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

Because you have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and you're often actively engaged in bringing them them to life with your favorite software), it can be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with your collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that your client or collaborator may not yet understand how and what you're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what you're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance you well. 

Here are a list of some of the Artist Types that you may work well with and some of the reasons why: 

*• The Feeler Artist* - because they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed your fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.

*• The Visionary Artist* - because they can help you zoom out when you're in a hyper-focused state of mind. 

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to your session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals.

*• The Dreamer Artist* - because they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the ones and zeroes, The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.

*The Visionary Artist*

You have a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives you a natural understanding of what we call ""The 3 Ps"";

*• Patterns*
*• Potential*
*• Path*

You often recognize patterns that help you see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. 

Because of this you can often see the end result quite clearly in your mind’s eye (or sense it in an abstract way). You're then able see a viable path to complete your vision successfully.

This view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that you have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.

 Though you have an extraordinary gift for ""seeing the forest for the trees"", when you're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, you may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things. For this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with these other artist types:

*• The Feeler Artist* - because this artist is very much in touch with their feelings in present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which you can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.

*• The Consummate Artist* - because this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, as the consummate professional. This can have a helpful practical effect on your vision based perspective. If you want a collaborator that is there to help bring your vision to life in the down-to-earth details, this can be a great pairing.

*• The Entertainer* *Artist* - because, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of your vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while you're guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to engage with and express each idea with passion and vitality. 

*• The Tortured Artist* - because this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for you. Particularly if you are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.

*The Maverick Artist*

You're a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, *The Maverick Artist* is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.

Even in collaborations you tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving your own way. That said, you're often happy to bring your collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow your lead and add fuel to your fire. 

You have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.

Given a pronounced a focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for *The Maverick Artist* to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for you to collaborate with artist types that balance you out. These include: 

*• The Consummate Artist* - because they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.

*• The Entertainer Artist* - because in some ways you're cut from the same cloth, yet you have different goals. You both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas they're born to entertain your focus is on creating what they'll want to perform. If your tastes align and your personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing. 

*• The Tech Artist* - because they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture your unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever you throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.

*The Tech Artist*

Not only are you a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, you also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the gear and technology involved in making your creative ideas a reality in your chosen medium. You have a natural affinity for the tools of your trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage it to express a creative idea or vision. 

You are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. You thrive when you can completely immerse yourself in your work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.

You also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into your creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes you a huge asset to almost any creative situations in your chosen field. You thrive in settings where you can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.
